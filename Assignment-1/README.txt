This project involves developing a program in C that loads and executes ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. ELF is a common file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps in Unix-like operating systems. The purpose of this program is to load an ELF file, locate the entry point of the executable code, and execute it. Members: 1. Priyanshu Sharma -2023408 2. Vansh tyagi- 2023582
